## Develop Test scenarios and scripts
The code can perfectly get image URL, download them, and convert them to a vedio/vedioes.
However, It appears credential problem when calling Google Vision.

Before I ran the code, in terminal, I exported Google applicaiton Credential of my own json file:
```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/Users/rzhan/Desktop/Alzheimer\'s-683341b411e6.json"
```
Then I ran the code, after converting images into vedio, there came error shows that:
```
google.auth.exceptions.DefaultCredentialsError: File /Users/rzhan/Desktop/Alzheimer\'s-683341b411e6.json was not found.
```
So I just designed test for the first two steps.

I tried to give a wrong twitter ID in command line, and it returned error message like this

Then I gave an empty screen page, it showed following result

As no images are downloaded, FMPEG also raises error

Images above shows that the program handles error inputs very well!

Then I changed the twitter ID to @ladygaga, it works!(But also failed in calling Google Vision)

Next is time measure.

Time of getting URL and downloading is

Time of converting images to vedioes is

## Local webpage


To run the local website, please make sure that you have download the whole content of folder https://github.com/RunzhouHan/EC500-c1/tree/master/hw2_code%20review%20by%20Runzhou%20Han/EC500

Then run __init__.py in command line. Then terminal will give an IP address to you. Open that website, it should be look like this

After clicking "call API" button, please wait for a few second to have the python backend download images and convert them into a mp4 vedio file. My website doesn't content output of Google Vision because of the code has some problem in getting credential.
